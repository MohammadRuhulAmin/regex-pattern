d. \t match only tab charecter
e. more about metacharecters [https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp]

15. make a regular expression that that the first atleast one charecter will digit,
then it a space then some word charecter betweeb 3-10
=>/\d\s\w{3,10}/


16. Write down the spacial charecters !
=>
a. '+' one or more quantifire
b. '\' the escape charecter
c. '[]' the charecter set 
d. '[^]' the negate symbol in charecter set
e. '?' zero or one quantifire (make a preciding charecter optional)
    Example:
        /hello?/ 
        here o is optional. if you remove o still hell will be matched!
        /he?llo?/
        means if you still remove e or o like hll will be matched
        /ppp[a-z]?ooo/
        means after `ppp` and before `ooo`  any charecter from a to z may stay or not doesnot care about it 
f. '.' any charecter except new line
g. '*' one or more quantifire (like '+' quantifire)
    Example:
    [a-z]* means 
    from a to z appears 0 or more than 1 times
