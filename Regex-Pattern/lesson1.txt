=========[Regular Expression]================

1. i want to parse only the name : 
=> / ruhulamin /

2. i want to match only ruhul or buhul or kuhul 
=> /[rbk]uhul /

3. i want to match a,b,c,d,1,3,4,2 these charecters 
=> /[abcd1234]/ 
no other charecters will be matched!

4. i want a,b,c,d,e,f ,1,2,3 any of these charecters or numbers after PQRS
=>/[abcdef123]PQRS/

5. i want any charecters before pqrs but except M 
=>/[^M]pqrs/

6. i want any charecters before pqrs except 12@lmn
=>/[^12@lmn]pqrs/

7. i want any lower case alphabetic charecters before pqrs
=>/[a-z]pqrs/

8. i want any number before pqrs
=>/[0-9]pqrs/

9. i want to match exactly 11 digits phone number 
=>/[0-9]{11}/   {this is digit number}

10. i want any number as large as possible 
=>/[0-9]+/

11. i want an 11 exect lettered word
=>[a-z]{11}


12. i want any letter that is 5 to 8 length long 
=>/[a-z]{5,8}/

13. i want any letter that atleast 5 length long
=>/[a-z]{5,}/ 

14.what are meta charecters ? explaine it!
=>
a. \d [match any digit charecter as same as [0-9]]
b. \w [match any alphabetic charecter as same as a-z or A-Z , 0-9 or _'s]  
c. \s match any space charecter (space, tabs etc)
d. \t match only tab charecter
e. more about metacharecters [https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp]

15. make a regular expression that that the first atleast one charecter will digit,
then it a space then some word charecter betweeb 3-10
=>/\d\s\w{3,10}/


16. Write down the spacial charecters !
=>
a. '+' one or more quantifire
b. '\' the escape charecter
c. '[]' the charecter set 
d. '[^]' the negate symbol in charecter set
e. '?' zero or one quantifire (make a preciding charecter optional)
    Example:
        /hello?/ 
        here o is optional. if you remove o still hell will be matched!
        /he?llo?/
        means if you still remove e or o like hll will be matched
        /ppp[a-z]?ooo/
        means after `ppp` and before `ooo`  any charecter from a to z may stay or not doesnot care about it 
f. '.' any charecter except new line
g. '*' one or more quantifire (like '+' quantifire)
    Example:
    [a-z]* means 
    from a to z appears 0 or more than 1 times 

17. what is starting pattern ? 

=>/^[a-z]{5}/
here ^ makes the starting pattern. it will only match the first five charecters.

18. What is ending pattern ? 

=> /[a-z]{5}$/
here $ makes the ending pattern.  in this example only the last 5 charecters will be matched!

19. write a start and end patern both 

=> /^[a-z]{5,10}$/ 
here atleast 5 charecters need to write and atmost 10 charecters will be accepted .
